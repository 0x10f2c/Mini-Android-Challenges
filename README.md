# Mini Android Challenges

This is a small Android Challenge application designed to be vulnerable for testing hacking skills against.
It currently only features five challenges although this may change in the future.
This application can be built from the source code in the MiniAndroidChallenges folder, or you can download and install the APK directly from the releases page.
