# Mini Android Challenges

This is a small Android Challenge application designed to be vulnerable for testing android hacking and penetration skills against.
It currently only features five challenges although this may change in the future when I dive into making a kotlin version.
This application can be built from the source code in the MiniAndroidChallenges folder, or you can download and install the APK directly from the releases page.

Feel free to reuse the code or any challenges; also open to any contributions including writeups and walkthroughs.
